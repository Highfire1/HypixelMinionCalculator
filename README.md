A calculator for calculating hypixel skyblock minion profits






But why?

Minions are incredibly unintuitive. If you calculate their output naively, then you will end up with the wrong answer.



### Offline calculations:
Offline calculations are not intuitive because it uses a single calculation across time:

**Compactable** items get calculated first. these items are then put into the minions inventory.
If any items do not fit, they are sold through the hopper or destroyed.

After that, non-compactable items are calculated. Then those are placed into the minion inventory. If any items do not fit, they sold through the hopper or destroyed.



### [insert minion upgrade here] is so expensive! I want to buy fashionable armor instead?
Although many high level minion upgrades have high cost, you should weigh this against what alternative use you have for the coins. A postcard worth $100 million means that with 30 minions, each minion needs to generate an additional $3.3 million to pay off the postcard. A 5% boost means that over that time, each minion would have generated $66 million without the postcard.
If you think you can invest the money at a higher rate of return, then do that! If the money is sitting in your bank doing nothing then you should spend it on minion upgrades. Most minion upgrades do not lose much value by being used, and you can later resell them if you want the cash.
